## Short Guide

To see a model just drop it into the screen, you can also unload the current model and the engine will still work while empty.

### Menus

There are 3 main menus:
- Console
- Sidebar
- Model properties

They can be closed and reopened from the upper menu bar. Each of them has a series of options related to the modules they are contained in.

### Camera Controls
- **Navigate & rotate:** right click movement + wasd (arrows can be used to rotate)
- **Orbit:** alt + left click movement
- **Focus (Look at object):** F key
- **Zoom (Change fov):** mouse wheel

## Extra features
- Basic phong (no specular): It computes light by (difuse + specular) * light_color * texture_color. It also has a simple menu to play with it.
- Bounding box drawing and some render options.
- Small camera additions, auto extend far plane based on bounding box and lock camera on object.
- Default gui alignment based on window size.

## Notes
Some models are big which can make camera arrow movement look slow, it can also make positional light work poorly (you can switch to directional).

Models are from Cl√†udia Escuder.
